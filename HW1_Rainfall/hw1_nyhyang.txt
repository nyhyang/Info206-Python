Reflection on Rainfall Redux Problem

There are three main parts that I found tricky while I was doing the test : 1. Retrieving data 2.ValueError 3. DivZero

The first time I tried to import data, I used .readlines().split(). When I use index[0] for the data, thereâ€™s some problem in the test cases like example 3 (3garbages). It still added the 3 into my count list while it was not expected. I think it would be tricky for the students doing this and did not consider this scenario. 

Besides negative numbers, tester will also need to take into consideration if the data is not a number. This might be tricky because students would assume only the number scenario mentioned in the instruction (take non-negative number) if no further examples are given. 

Div Zero is tricky because it is not necessarily wrong with the codes yet need to be taken into consideration after cleaning the data.

My takeaway after doing the place-in and reading the paper is that it would be helpful to come up with some test cases that may not seem straightforward. The examples given in the place-in is helpful during the test but in the real world we will need to think of all the corner cases on our own.
